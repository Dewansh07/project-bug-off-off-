Hey contestant we welcome you to our event BugOff!!! here are some basic instructions and guidelines to follow during the event.

1)The given website consists of many UI bugs white-spaces, Irregular sizes of components etc which we expect you to solve and improve upon.
2)The based template of the website consists of a components folder within which there are files that consists of the data ou can start with. Each folder within also consists of its own css file which has been linked. 
3)outside the components file there are mainly 2 important files.
    a)contextProvider file
        which as the name suggests is the file that consists of the state within which the user information is stored and using useContext this information is passed onto all the child components
    b)firebase_config file
        This file consists of the firebase SDK and other important firebase functions which are required for the website. You can copy paste your SDK within this file.

4)Functionality.
    This is website which Aims to provide its users with several workout plans. All the plans that the website offers provided by the different trainers should be  available on the pricing. We expect you to create a collection within firebase consisting of the attributes given within the 'plans' state inside the prices.js file
    and fetch these plans and display it accordingly

   Hence when the user clicks on the add plan button it must be added to the user CART within the user collection that was generated during the registration process
   You must also try and incorporate the ability to delete ITEMS from the cart and add other features upon this basic functionality of the website

5)You can incorporate other features and Alter the UI to make it aesthetically pleasing but we expect the website to have as less console,UI errors etc.. as possible

Feel free to approach us in case of any confusion or problems regarding the instructions.
All the very Best.
